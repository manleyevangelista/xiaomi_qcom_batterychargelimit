description=A Magisk module that brings "Battery Protection" on older Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO devices, that do not already have the option in the Settings app. This limits battery charging to 80%. Everything required to turn this on is already available under the hood—it’s just that for some reason, Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO didn’t make it available in the Settings app (on Poco F5 and older). This mod aims to fix that.
